<h3 style="text-align:center"><u> WHY ARE THERE LESS WOMEN IN STEM? </u><h3>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:center"> Women feel alienated while working in tech roles,  a 1996 USA study suggested girls begin to lose self-confidence in middle school because they believe that men possess more intelligence in technological fields.</li>

<li style="text-align:center">This is due to men outperforming women in spatial analysis, a skillset many engineering professionals deem vital, generates this misconception. scholars found that boys are more likely to gain spatial skills outside the classroom because they are culturally encouraged to build and work with their hands </li>

<li style="text-align:center"> According to the Kapor Center for Social Impact and Harris Poll, One in 10 women in tech experience unwanted sexual attention, and nearly one in four people of color face stereotyping.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p style="text-align:center"><u>How can you help bring more women in Stem?</u></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:center"> Encourage girls to develop an interest in math and sciences is between the ages of 11 and 15</li>
<li style="text-align:center">Have more female role models spoken about in Tech that can inspire the younger generation of women to want to be in tech. For example, Albert Einstein and Charles Darwin.</li>
<li style="text-align:center">Help bring more awareness with global recognition like October 11 marked the international day of the girl whose purpose is to recognize the obstacles that young girls across the world face, and to encourage female unity and empowerment.</li>
<li style="text-align:center">Understanding and taking a stand against biases that favor male students among science faculty members.</li>
<li style="text-align:center">There is a need for more groups that encourage women to go into the STEM fields. Groups that can help guide women in tech fields can be an effective tool to retain women in technology roles. Research indicates that in the science, engineering, and technology field, women report feelings of isolation in hostile male-dominated work environments. In the United States, 32% of women who enter the SET field leave their job within a year.</li>

<p style="text-align:center"><u> FUTURE ATTEMPT TO RAISING AWARENESS OF WOMEN IN STEM </u><p>
  <ul>
    <li style="text-align:center">More than 80 percent of women say they have been sexually assaulted or harassed in comparescent to the 43 percent of men.</li>
    <li style="text-align:center">Create a that game hosts a female character who has been facing harassment at work, She decides to fight the patriarchy and revolutionizes against her bosses masagonistic comments.</li>
    <li style="text-align:center">The purpose of the game is to provide a platform where males can play and get the simulation of what harassment is like from a female’s perspective. Females can also play and feel empowered while playing.</li>
